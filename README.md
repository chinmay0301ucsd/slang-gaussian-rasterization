# Slang.D Volumetrically Consistent Rasterizer for 3DGS

This repository contains the Slang.D implementation of the rasterizer used in [Vol3DGS](https://github.com/chinmay0301ucsd/Vol3DGS).
The codebase is built on top of the slang implementation of 3DGS [slang-gaussian-rasterization](https://github.com/grgkopanas/slang-gaussian-rasterization.git), with similar instructions to use it with an existing 3DGS codebase. 

To install the rasterizer separately -- 
```
git clone https://github.com/chinmay0301ucsd/slang-gaussian-rasterization
cd ./slang-gaussian-rasterization
pip install -e .
```


## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Sai Praveen Bangaru and Alexander Mai for discussions on Slang, and George Kopanas for releasing the slang implementation of 3DGS.
